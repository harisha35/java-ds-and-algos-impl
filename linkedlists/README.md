## Basic Questions on Linked Lists:

A **_Linked List_** is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each object also called as node has its own data and the address of next object/node, thus forming a chain of nodes/objects.

### Common Questions on Singly Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists and Circular Linked Lists:

1. Traversing the List
2. Inserting element to the list
  * inserting at the start
  * inserting intermediate nodes
  * inserting at the end of the list
3. Deleting element from the list
  * deleting at the start
  * deleting intermediate nodes
  * deleting at the end of the list
4. Searching for an element/node in the list

### Questions on Singly Linked Lists:

1. nth node from start, end of the list
2. Check for cycle in the list, also find out the start and size of the cycle
3. Reverse a linked list in terms of k, where k is a variable integer
4. Merge k sorted linked lists
5. Check if linked list is palindrome or not
